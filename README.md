# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for writing this study guide is to encourage good practice and consistent reflection on my progress as a full-stack web developer. I built this project to organize sections of web development topics (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript) to have them in one place for effective study. It solves the problem of continually having to think about what I need to study next and allows for a quick and easy study session to review what I've learned. In this process, I've learned that there is always a way to accomplish a task and to keep moving forward despite barriers that may arise with bugs and lack of knowledge.

To use this study guide, you will observe that there are four topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, as well as running JavaScript withing the DevTools console, which lists the topics currently being worked on and studied. The console will randomly list a topic among those included on the page that we can study first.
