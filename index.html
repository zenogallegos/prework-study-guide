        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>We can use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To link CSS to HTML, we use the element "link" in the "head" section of HTML with rel="stylsheet" and href="[stylesheet location]"</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Typing 'git add -A' will commit all files to the working branch</li>
          <li>'git commit -m' will commit the changes to the repository</li>
          <li>Always use 'git pull origin main' before pushing to pull the base branch into your current branch</li>
          <li>Use 'git push origin (name of branch)' to push your commit</li>
          <li>Update the local repository by using 'git checkout main' and then 'git pull origin main'</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To link JavaScript to HTML, we use the element "script" within the "body" element of the HTML document with src="[Javascript location]</li>
          <li>An array can hold various types of data that all use one variable. This is done by using var variable-name=["name", "name", "name"]</li>
          <li>Arrays: each item in an array is assigned a number that starts from 0 and goes up a whole number for each item within the array. An array might be constructed like this:</br></br>
            var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</br></br></li>
          <li>For Statements: these statemetns can list items in an array by using a loop. a loop can be created from an array as follows:</br></br>
            var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</br></br>
            for (var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {</br></br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(shapes[x]);</br></br>
            }</br></br>
            The "var x = 0" defines the starting point and identifies which index of the array to target first, 
            "x < shapes.length" gives a boolean comparison, which is essential a condition for how many times the loop will repeat, where "shapes" is the variable of the entire array 
            and "length" is the amount of variables within the array, where the loop will repeat as long as the length of the array is more than x,
            and "x++", shorthand for "x + 1" is what will occur every time the loop runs. so in short, a loop will go like this:</br></br>
            for ([starting point], [sets limits for the loop], [what happens for every loop])</li>
